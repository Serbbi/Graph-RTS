# Graph RTS

All that is useful to understand about the project is already written in the [other README](rts/README.md)(which contains
the requirements of the project that we had to follow) and in the [report](rts/report.md)(which contains a short introduction
and the program design). 

## How to run
Just go to the `Main` class and run the program from there.
